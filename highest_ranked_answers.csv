"about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?","Uveitis: Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. Examples are: - Ankylosing spondylitis - Psoriasis - Reactive arthritis - Rheumatoid arthritis - Sarcoidosis - Ulcerative colitis Uveitis can also be caused by infections such as: - AIDS - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis - Herpes zoster infection - Histoplasmosis - Kawasaki disease - Syphilis - Toxoplasmosis - Tuberculosis Exposure to toxins or injury can also cause uveitis. In many cases, the cause is unknown. The most common form of uveitis involves inflammation the front part of the eye. It is often called iritis because it most often only affects the iris. The iris is the colored part of the eye. In most cases, it occurs in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people. Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the eye. It involves primarily the choroid.Â This is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle layer of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis. Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. Changes involve the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid. Pars planitis most often occurs in young men. It is generally not associated with any other disease. However, it may be linked to Crohn disease and possibly multiple sclerosis. Uveitis can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may develop rapidly and can include: - Blurred vision - Dark, floating spots in the vision - Eye pain - Redness of the eye - Sensitivity to light The health care provider will take a complete medical history and do an eye exam. Lab tests may be done to rule out infection or a weak immune system. If you are over age 25 and have pars planitis, your provider will suggest a brain and spine MRI. This will rule out multiple sclerosis. Iritis (anterior uveitis) is most often mild. Treatment may involve: - Dark glasses - Eye drops that dilate the pupil to relieve pain - Steroid eye drops Pars planitis is often treated with steroid eye drops. Other medicines, including steroids taken by mouth, may be used to help suppress the immune system. Posterior uveitis treatment depends on the underlying cause. It almost always includes steroids taken by mouth. If the uveitis is caused by a body-wide (systemic) infection, you may be given antibiotics. You may also be given powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids. With proper treatment, most attacks of anterior uveitis go away in a few days to weeks. However, the problem often returns. Posterior uveitis may last from months to years. It may cause permanent vision damage, even with treatment. Complications may include: - Cataracts - Fluid within the retina - Glaucoma - Irregular pupil - Retinal detachment - Vision loss Symptoms that need urgent medical care are: - Eye pain - Reduced vision If you have a body-wide (systemic) infection or disease, treating the condition will prevent uveitis.

This tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. This may lead to pressure behind the eardrum or an ear infection. Ear pain in adults is less likely to be from an ear infection. Pain that you feel in the ear may be coming from another place, such as your teeth, the joint in your jaw (temporomandibular joint), or your throat. This is called ""referred"" pain. Causes of ear pain may include: Arthritis of the jaw Short-term ear infection Long-term ear infection Ear injury from pressure changes (from high altitudes and other causes) Object stuck in the ear or buildup of ear wax Hole in the eardrum Sinus infection Sore throat Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ) Tooth infection Ear pain in a child or infant may be due to infection.

However, instead of flaking off the scalp, they stay in place. Head lice can live up to 30 days on a human. Their eggs can live for more than 2 weeks. Head lice spread easily, particularly among school children. Head lice are more common in close, overcrowded living conditions. You can get head lice if: You come in close contact with a person who has lice. You touch the clothing or bedding of someone who has lice. You share hats, towels, brushes, or combs of someone who has lice. Having head lice causes intense itching but does not lead to serious medical problems. Unlike body lice, head lice never carry or spread diseases. Having head lice does NOT mean the person has poor hygiene or low social status.",10.0

ClinicalTrials.gov - General Complaint. Please help me out as to whom to consult for anxiety and depression,"Drug allergies (Drug allergies, Allergic reaction - drug (medication) , Drug hypersensitivity , Medication hypersensitivity): Drug allergies are a group of symptoms caused by an allergic reaction to a drug (medicine). A drug allergy involves an immune response in the body that produces an allergic reaction to a medicine. The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. But, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the antibody may tell your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine. Histamines and other chemicals cause your allergy symptoms. Common allergy-causing drugs include: Drugs used to treat seizures Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin) Substances containing iodine, such as x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions) Penicillin and related antibiotics Sulfa drugs Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause hives or trigger asthma without involving the immune system. Many people confuse an unpleasant, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a drug allergy. Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. These symptoms may occur right away or hours after receiving the drug. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine. Common symptoms of a drug allergy include: Hives Itching of the skin or eyes (common) Skin rash (common) Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face Wheezing Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Abdominal pain or cramping Confusion Diarrhea Difficulty breathing with wheezing or hoarse voice Dizziness Fainting, lightheadedness Hives over different parts of the body Nausea, vomiting Rapid pulse Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) An examination may show: Decreased blood pressure Hives Rash Swelling of the lips, face, or tongue (angioedema) Wheezing Skin testing may help diagnose an allergy to penicillin-type medicines. There are no good skin or blood tests to help diagnose other drug allergies. If you have had allergy-like symptoms after taking a medicine or receiving contrast (dye) before getting an x-ray, your health care provider will often tell you that this is proof of a drug allergy. You do not need more testing. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction. Treatment may include: Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough) Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously) Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis The offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have. In some cases, a penicillin (or other drug) allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take. Most drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death. Call your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have difficulty breathing or develop other symptoms of severe asthma or anaphylaxis. These are emergency conditions. There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy. If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the drug is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines. In some cases, a provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with medicines that slow or block the immune response. These include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines. Do not try this without a provider's supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent allergic reactions in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye. Your provider may also recommend desensitization.

Best Regards","IMH Â» Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (Treatment and Therapies): While there is no cure for ADHD, currently available treatments can help reduce symptoms and improve functioning. Treatments include medication, psychotherapy, education or training, or a combination of treatments. Medication For many people, ADHD medications reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity and improve their ability to focus, work, and learn. Medication also may improve physical coordination. Sometimes several different medications or dosages must be tried before finding the right one that works for a particular person. Anyone taking medications must be monitored closely and carefully by their prescribing doctor. Stimulants. The most common type of medication used for treating ADHD is called a ""stimulant."" Although it may seem unusual to treat ADHD with a medication that is considered a stimulant, it works because it increases the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine, which play essential roles in thinking and attention. Under medical supervision, stimulant medications are considered safe. However, there are risks and side effects, especially when misused or taken in excess of the prescribed dose.For example, stimulants can raise blood pressure and heart rate and increase anxiety. Therefore, a person with other health problems, including high blood pressure, seizures, heart disease, glaucoma, liver or kidney disease, or an anxiety disorder should tell their doctor before taking a stimulant. Talk with a doctor if you see any of these side effects while taking stimulants: decreased appetite sleep problems tics (sudden, repetitive movements or sounds); personality changes increased anxiety and irritability stomachaches headaches Non-stimulants. A few other ADHD medications are non-stimulants. These medications take longer to start working than stimulants, but can also improve focus, attention, and impulsivity in a person with ADHD. Doctors may prescribe a non-stimulant: when a person has bothersome side effects from stimulants; when a stimulant was not effective; or in combination with a stimulant to increase effectiveness. Although not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for the treatment of ADHD, some antidepressants are sometimes used alone or in combination with a stimulant to treat ADHD. Antidepressants may help all of the symptoms of ADHD and can be prescribed if a patient has bothersome side effects from stimulants. Antidepressants can be helpful in combination with stimulants if a patient also has another condition, such as an anxiety disorder, depression, or another mood disorder. Doctors and patients can work together to find the best medication, dose, or medication combination. Learn the basics about stimulants and other mental health medications on the NIMH Mental Health Medications webpage and check the FDAwebsite (http://www.fda.gov/), for the latest information on warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications. Psychotherapy Adding psychotherapy to treat ADHD can help patients and their families to better cope with everyday problems. Behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that aims to help a person change his or her behavior. It might involve practical assistance, such as help organizing tasks or completing schoolwork, or working through emotionally difficult events. Behavioral therapy also teaches a person how to: monitor his or her own behavior give oneself praise or rewards for acting in a desired way, such as controlling anger or thinking before acting Parents, teachers, and family members also can give positive or negative feedback for certain behaviors and help establish clear rules, chore lists, and other structured routines to help a person control his or her behavior. Therapists may also teach children social skills, such as how to wait their turn, share toys, ask for help, or respond to teasing. Learning to read facial expressions and the tone of voice in others, and how to respond appropriately can also be part of social skills training. Cognitive behavioral therapy can also teach a person mindfulness techniques, or meditation. A person learns how to be aware and accepting of one's own thoughts and feelings to improve focus and concentration. The therapist also encourages the person with ADHD to adjust to the life changes that come with treatment, such as thinking before acting, or resisting the urge to take unnecessary risks. Family and marital therapy can help family members and spouses find better ways to handle disruptive behaviors, to encourage behavior changes, and improve interactions with the patient. For more information on psychotherapy, see the Psychotherapies webpage on the NIMH website. Education and Training Children and adults with ADHD need guidance and understanding from their parents, families, and teachers to reach their full potential and to succeed. For school-age children, frustration, blame, and anger may have built up within a family before a child is diagnosed. Parents and children may need special help to overcome negative feelings. Mental health professionals can educate parents about ADHD and how it affects a family. They also will help the child and his or her parents develop new skills, attitudes, and ways of relating to each other. Parenting skills training (behavioral parent management training) teaches parents the skills they need to encourage and reward positive behaviors in their children. It helps parents learn how to use a system of rewards and consequences to change a child's behavior. Parents are taught to give immediate and positive feedback for behaviors they want to encourage, and ignore or redirect behaviors that they want to discourage. They may also learn to structure situations in ways that support desired behavior. Stress management techniques can benefit parents of children with ADHD by increasing their ability to deal with frustration so that they can respond calmly to their child's behavior. Support groups can help parents and families connect with others who have similar problems and concerns. Groups often meet regularly to share frustrations and successes, to exchange information about recommended specialists and strategies, and to talk with experts. Tips to Help Kids and Adults with ADHD Stay Organized For Kids: Parents and teachers can help kids with ADHD stay organized and follow directions with tools such as: Keeping a routine and a schedule. Keep the same routine every day, from wake-up time to bedtime. Include times for homework, outdoor play, and indoor activities. Keep the schedule on the refrigerator or on a bulletin board in the kitchen. Write changes on the schedule as far in advance as possible. Organizing everyday items. Have a place for everything, and keep everything in its place. This includes clothing, backpacks, and toys. Using homework and notebook organizers. Use organizers for school material and supplies. Stress to your child the importance of writing down assignments and bringing home the necessary books. Being clear and consistent. Children with ADHD need consistent rules they can understand and follow. Giving praise or rewards when rules are followed. Children with ADHD often receive and expect criticism. Look for good behavior, and praise it. For Adults: A professional counselor or therapist can help an adult with ADHD learn how to organize his or her life with tools such as: Keeping routines Making lists for different tasks and activities Using a calendar for scheduling events Using reminder notes Assigning a special place for keys, bills, and paperwork Breaking down large tasks into more manageable, smaller steps so that completing each part of the task provides a sense of accomplishment.",11.0

Episodes can begin at any age but most often begin in early childhood. Fevers typically last about 3 weeks but can last from a few days to a few months. The amount of time between episodes may vary from weeks to years. Episodes usually occur spontaneously, but are sometimes brought on by a variety of triggers (such as injury, infection, or stress). Symptoms during fever episodes may include abdominal, muscle or joint pains; skin rashes (usually on the limbs); puffiness around the eyes; and inflammation in various areas of the body. Some people develop amyloidosis. [1] TRAPS is caused by mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

It worries me so.,"Preeclampsia (Treatment): Preeclampsia often resolves after the baby is born and the placenta is delivered. However, it may persist or even begin after delivery. Most often, at 37 weeks, your baby is developed enough to be healthy outside of the womb. As a result, your provider will likely want your baby to be delivered so the preeclampsia does not get worse. You may get medicines to help trigger labor, or you may need a C-section. If your baby is not fully developed and you have mild preeclampsia, the disease can often be managed at home until your baby has matured. The provider will recommend: Frequent doctor visits to make sure you and your baby are doing well. Medicines to lower your blood pressure (sometimes). The severity of preeclampsia may change quickly, so you'll need very careful follow-up. Complete bed rest is no longer recommended. Sometimes, a pregnant woman with preeclampsia is admitted to the hospital. This allows the health care team to watch the baby and mother more closely. Treatment in the hospital may include: Close monitoring of the mother and baby Medicines to control blood pressure and prevent seizures and other complications Steroid injections for pregnancies under 34 weeks gestation to help speed up the development of the baby's lungs You and your provider will continue to discuss the safest time to deliver your baby, considering: How close you are to your due date. The severity of the preeclampsia. Preeclampsia has many severe complications that can harm the mother. How well the baby is doing in the womb. The baby must be delivered if there are signs of severe preeclampsia. These include: Tests that show your baby is not growing well or is not getting enough blood and oxygen. The bottom number of your blood pressure is over 110 mm Hg or is greater than 100 mm Hg consistently over a 24-hour period. Abnormal liver function test results. Severe headaches. Pain in the belly area (abdomen). Seizures or changes in mental function (eclampsia). Fluid buildup in the mother's lungs. HELLP syndrome (rare). Low platelet count or bleeding.

How to Stop Snoring. How to Stop Snoring,"Snoring (Lifestyle and home remedies): To prevent or quiet snoring, try these tips: - If you're overweight, lose weight. People who are overweight may have extra tissues in the throat that contribute to snoring. Losing weight can help reduce snoring. - Sleep on your side. Lying on your back allows your tongue to fall backward into your throat, narrowing your airway and partially obstructing airflow. Try sleeping on your side. If you find that you always end up on your back in the middle of the night, try sewing a tennis ball in the back of your pajama top. - Raise the head of your bed. Raising the head of your bed by about 4 inches may help. - Nasal strips or an external nasal dilator. Adhesive strips applied to the bridge of the nose help many people increase the area of their nasal passage, enhancing their breathing. A nasal dilator is a stiffened adhesive strip applied externally across the nostrils that may help decrease airflow resistance so you breathe easier. Nasal strips and external nasal dilators aren't effective for people with OSA, however. - Treat nasal congestion or obstruction. Having allergies or a deviated septum can limit airflow through your nose. This forces you to breathe through your mouth, increasing the likelihood of snoring. Ask your doctor about a prescription steroid spray if you have chronic congestion. To correct a structural defect in your airway, such as a deviated septum, you may need surgery. - Limit or avoid alcohol and sedatives. Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages at least two hours before bedtime, and let your doctor know about your snoring before taking sedatives. Sedatives and alcohol depress your central nervous system, causing excessive relaxation of muscles, including the tissues in your throat. - Quit smoking.

It usually appears as tumors on the skin or on mucosal surfaces such as inside the mouth, but tumors can also develop in other parts of the body (including the lymph nodes , lungs, or digestive tract). The abnormal cells of Kaposi sarcoma cause purplish, reddish blue, or dark brown/black skin lesions ( macules, nodules, plaques) on the legs and the face. These lesions may look bad, but they usually cause no symptoms. However, when the lesions are in the lungs, liver, or digestive tract, they may cause serious problems like gastrointestinal bleeding or trouble breathing. [1] Kaposi sarcoma is caused by infection with a virus called the Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8). [2] Kaposi sarcoma is classified into four types based upon the different populations in which it develops: classic (which presents in middle or old age), endemic (described in sub-Saharan indigenous Africans), iatrogenic (associated with immunosuppressive drug therapy) and AIDS-associated (epidemic KS). [3] Options for treatment may include local therapy , radiation therapy , chemotherapy and biologic therapy ( immunotherapy ). The main aim is to restore immunity.

"Medical Diagnosis of Asbestosis. My doctors hint that I have asbestosis but do not say I have asbestosis. All the medical information that I have read from the CDC, Medlin and NIH all say that the symptoms presented are related to a high level of asbestos. Why won't the doctor say it?","Screen time and children: ""Screen time"" is a term used for activities done in front of a screen, such as watching TV, working on a computer, or playing video games. Screen time is sedentary activity, meaning you are being physically inactive while sitting down. Very little energy is used during screen time. Most American children spend about 3 hours a day watching TV. Added together, all types of screen time can total 5 to 7 hours a day. Too much screen time can: Make it hard for your child to sleep at night Raise your child's risk for attention problems, anxiety, and depression Raise your child's risk for gaining too much weight (obesity) Screen time increases your child's risk for obesity because: Sitting and watching a screen is time that is not spent being physically active. TV commercials and other screen ads can lead to unhealthy food choices. Most of the time, the foods in ads that are aimed at kids are high in sugar, salt, or fats. Children eat more when they are watching TV, especially if they see ads for food. Computers can help kids with their schoolwork. But surfing the internet, spending too much time on Facebook, or watching YouTube videos is considered unhealthy screen time. Children under age 2 should have no screen time. Limit screen time to 1 to 2 hours a day for children over age 2. Despite what ads may say, videos that are aimed at very young children do not improve their development. Cutting down to 2 hours a day can be hard for some children because TV may be such a large part of their daily routines. But you can help your children by telling them how sedentary activities affect their overall health. Talk to them about things they can do to be healthier. To decrease screen time: Remove the TV or computer from your child's bedroom. DO NOT allow TV watching during meals or homework. DO NOT let your child eat while watching TV or using the computer. DO NOT leave the TV on for background noise. Turn on the radio instead, or have no background noise. Decide which programs to watch ahead of time. Turn off the TV when those programs are over. Suggest other activities, such as family board games, puzzles, or going for a walk. Keep a record of how much time is spent in front of a screen. Try to spend the same amount of time being active. Be a good role model as a parent. Decrease your own screen time to 2 hours a day. If it is hard not having the TV on, try using a sleep function so it turns off automatically. Challenge your family to go 1 week without watching TV or doing other screen-time activities. Find things to do with your time that get you moving and burning energy. Updated by: Liora C.
